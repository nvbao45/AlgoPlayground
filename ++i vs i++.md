# i++ vs ++i

The difference between `++i` and `i++` lies in the order of operations:
- `++i` (Pre-increment):
    - The value of `i` is incremented first.
    - Then, the incremented value of `i` is returned.
- `i++` (Post-increment):
    - The original value of `i` is returned.
    - Then, the value of `i` is incremented.

Here's a simple way to illustrate this:  

```c
int i = 1;
int a =  ++i; // i is now 2, a is also 2

int j = 1;
int b = j++;  // j is now 2, b is 1
```

**Key Points**:
- In isolation: If you're simply incrementing a variable without using its value in the same expression (e.g., `i++;` or `++i;` on its own line), there's generally no practical difference.
- In expressions: The difference becomes significant when the increment operator is used within a larger expression.
- Performance:
    - In many cases, modern compilers optimize these operations, especially for basic types like intergers, so there might be no performance difference.
    - However, when dealing with complex objects (like iterators in C++), `++i` can sometimes be more efficient because `i++` might involve creating a temporary copy of the object.
- For Loops: when used inside of the increment portion of a for loop, either one will work.
    - `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){}`
    - `for (int i = 0l i < 10l ++i){}`
