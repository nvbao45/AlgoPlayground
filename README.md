# Algorithms Playground
A space for experimenting with algorithms.

## Description
- This repository contains various algorithms implemented in `C++` and `Python`. The goal is to provide a playground for testing and learning about different algorithms and data structures.  
- Some algorithms are implemented in a more efficient way than others, and some are just for fun. The focus is on learning and experimentation rather than production-ready code.  
- The problems are taken from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and the solutions are provided in `C++` and/or `Python`.
